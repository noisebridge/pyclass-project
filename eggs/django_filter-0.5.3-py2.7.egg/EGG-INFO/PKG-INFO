Description: Django-filter is a reusable Django application for allowing users to filter
        queryset dynamically.  It requires Python 2.4 or higher.  For usage and
        installation instructions consult the docs directory.
        
        Django-filter can be used for generating interfaces similar to the Django
        admin's ``list_filter`` interface.  It has an API very similar to Django's
        ``ModelForms``.  For example if you had a Product model you could have a
        filterset for it with the code::
        
            import django_filters
        
            class ProductFilterSet(django_filters.FilterSet):
                class Meta:
                    model = Product
                    fields = ['name', 'price', 'manufacturer']
        
        
        And then in your view you could do::
        
            def product_list(request):
                filterset = ProductFilterSet(request.GET or None)
                return render_to_response('product/product_list.html',
                    {'filterset': filterset})
        
        
        See the docs directory for more information.
