    Normally a view would redirect to the last page. After delete from a object
    in a detail-view, there is no "last page" so we redirect to this unique,
    shiny success-page.

{% endcomment %}

{% block frontendadmin_content %}
	<h2>You object was deleted!</h2>
	<p>Click the back-button in your browser or go to the <a href="/">frontpage</a>.</p>
{% endblock %}
