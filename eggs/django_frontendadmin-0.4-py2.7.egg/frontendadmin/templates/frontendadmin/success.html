    First, a view would redirect to the last page the user came from. If
    this is not available (because somebody fiddled in the url), we redirect
    to this common success page.

    Normally a user should never see this page.

	<h2>Success! Your object was changed.</h2>
	<p>Click the back-button in your browser or go to the <a href="/">frontpage</a>.</p>
