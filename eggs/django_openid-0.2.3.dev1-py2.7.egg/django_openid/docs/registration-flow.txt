Understanding the registration flow
===================================

The full flow for a site that offers login and registration using either 
OpenID or a regular username/password account can be quite complicated. This 
page shows how the flow implemented by django-openid works.

Login
-----

- With Username and Password:
    - (has link to switch to OpenID)
    - Incorrect login:
        - They get their username wrong:
            - "wrong username" message (defaults to same as wrong password)
        - They get their password wrong:
            - "wrong password" message
    - Correct login:
        - Have they verified their e-mail address?
            - Yes:
                - Log them in to that account.
            - No:
                - Tell them to verify their e-mail address
                - Option: send me that e-mail again
- With OpenID:
    - (has link to switch to username/password)
    - OpenID is invalid or authentication fails:
        - Tell them what happened, don't log them in
        - Show login or register UI
    - OpenID is valid and corresponds to an existing account:
        - Have they verified their e-mail address?
            - Yes:
                - Log them in to that account.
            - No:
                - Tell them to verify their e-mail address
                - Option: send me that e-mail again
    - OpenID is valid but does not correspond to an existing account:
        - Tell them, and offer a link to the registration form.              

Registration
------------

- Register with username/password:
    - Username/e-mail/password please
    - Repeat until valid
    - Send verification e-mail
    - Tell them "just one more step: click link in your e-mail"
- Register with OpenID:
    - Enter your OpenID:
        - OpenID is valid:
            - And not associated with existing account:
                - Show registration form, pre-filled with any details from OpenID provider
            - And associated with existing account:
                - Log them in - jump to "have they verified their e-mail address" bit in login with OpenID flow
        - OpenID is invalid:
            - Tell them what happened, link to login page

E-mail verification link clicked
--------------------------------

- Is verification code valid?
    - Yes:
        - Mark that account as verified
        - Log them straight in to that account
    - No:
        - Tell them it's invalid.
        - Provide a link to the homepage.

Recover account flow
--------------------

- Ask them for their:
    - E-mail address
    - or Username
    - or OpenID
- If valid information:
    - Send them an e-mail with a magic log-you-in link in it
- If invalid:
    - Tell them no account found.
    - Show form again.

Recover link clicked
--------------------

- If valid:
    - Log them in
    - Optionally show a reset-your-password screen
- If invalid:
    - Tell them to go away, link to homepage
